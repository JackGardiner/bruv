<X>:

COORDINATES:
  x = x coordinate.
  y = y coordinate.
  z = z coordinate.
  r = radial coordinate (typically along xy plane).
  theta = angular coordinate (convention depends on `r`:
               r along xy plane: theta measured from +X in direction of +Y
               r along zx plane: theta measured from +Z in direction of +X
               r along yz plane: theta measured from +Y in direction of +Z)
  phi = axial angle relative to +Z.
  L_ = length traced along this coordinate path (may be angular).
  M_ = coordinate of middle.

LENGTHS/ANGLES:
  R = radius
  D = diameter
  off = distance normal to surface.
  th = thickness normal to surface.
  wi = circumferential width (non-angular).
  ell = arc length.
  L = length (typically axial).
  I_ = inner length.
  O_ = outer length.
  M_ = middle length (average of inner and outer).
  semi_ = semi-length (half that length).
  FR = fillet radius.

ALL OTHER:
  A = area.
  AEAT = nozzle exit area to throat area ratio.
  beta = angle between two line segments.
  D_ = discrete change in this variable.
  NLF = nozzle length as a fraction of the length of a 15deg cone.
  no = number of things.
  Pr = pressure ratio, upstream / downstream.
  Prinv = pressure ratio, downstream / upstream.
